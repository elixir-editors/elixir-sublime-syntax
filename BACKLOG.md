# Backlog

The backlog contains tasks that are planned to be worked on or ideas that may be useful.

* Elixir: match do-block after function call: `func(a, b) do end`.
* Elixir: allow setting the seed used for `mix test` via a command or similar.
* Elixir: use ST4's branching feature to improve some rules.
* Elixir: try to fix the rules that don't work due to the "context sanity limit" error.
* Elixir: highlight `:atom`, `identifier`, `Module.X`, `M.func/1` in Markdown comments?
