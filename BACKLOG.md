# Backlog

The backlog contains tasks that are planned to be worked on or ideas that may be useful.

* Elixir: use ST4's branching feature to improve some rules.
* Elixir: try to fix the rules that don't work due to the "context sanity limit" error.
* Elixir: highlight `:atom`, `identifier`, `Module.X`, `M.func/1` in Markdown comments?
