# elixir-sublime-syntax

Elixir Sublime Syntax was based on the [Elixir.tmbundle package](https://github.com/elixir-editors/elixir-tmbundle) but has been rewritten since, providing more accurate syntax matching as well as better syntax highlighting.

## First release

- Transformed tm syntax into sublime syntax automatically
- Refactored syntax definition into reusable blocks
- Removed Ruby leftovers
- Rewrote Binary definition so it highlights correctly
- Fixed operator matching so they are displayed correctly on Sublime 3147 with fonts that has ligature support
